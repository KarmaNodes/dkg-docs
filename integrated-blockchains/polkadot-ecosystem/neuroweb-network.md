# Neuroweb Network

NeuroWeb Network is a decentralized Artificial Intelligence blockchain designed to incentivise knowledge creation, connectivity and sharing through **Knowledge Mining**. It's utility token NEURO is designed to fuel the AI knowledge economy, rewarding relevant knowledge contributions to the **OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph**.

NeuroWeb builds on the basis of its predecessor - the OriginTrail Parachain - which was transformed into NeuroWeb via a community Governance vote on OriginTrail Parachain in December 2023. NeuroWeb is a permissionless, EVM enabled blockchain secured by Polkadot validators.

Dedicated documentation for Neuroweb can be found [here](https://docs.neuroweb.ai/).

### Adding TRAC on Neuroweb to your wallet

Here are step by step instructions for adding TRAC token on Neuroweb to your wallet (in this case Metamask). These instructions and TRAC token address are same for both NeuroWeb mainnet and testnet.

TRAC token address: 0xFfFFFFff00000000000000000000000000000001

First open Metamask that is connected to NeuroWeb (connection details available here), then under the Assets tab click on `Import tokens`.

On the import tokens page you need to add TRAC token contract address and usually all other fields will be automatically populated by Metamask.

After you get all fields filled with right information (like on the image above), you click `Add custom tokens` and your TRAC balance will be displayed in Metamask.
