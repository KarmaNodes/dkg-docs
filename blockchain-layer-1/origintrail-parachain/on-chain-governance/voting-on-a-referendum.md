## 4. Select voting parameters

In the next menu, choose the amount of OTP you'd like to vote with, as well as your vote multiplier.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Multiplying your vote is a unique feature in governance that allows you to increase your voting power by voluntarily locking up the tokens for a specified amount of time, also known as "conviction voting". You can read more on this[ here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov#voluntary-locking).
