# OriginTrail Parachain Networks

There are currently 3 public networks running OriginTrail Parachain code:&#x20;

1. **OriginTrail Parachain Mainnet:** The OriginTrail Parachain main network secured by the Polkadot Relay Chain, with OTP as the native token and TRAC deployed as a native XC20 asset. This is the production environment.
2. **OriginTrail Parachain Testnet:** The OriginTrail Parachain test network secured by the Rococo Relay Chain hosted by Parity. This is the recommended development environment for anyone building on OriginTrail Parachain.
3. **OriginTrail Parachain Devnet:** The OriginTrail Parachain rapid development network secured by a relay chain hosted by TraceLabs. This chain is NOT RECOMMENDED for development purposes.

### OriginTrail Parachain Mainnet

Polkadot.js endpoint is available [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fparachain-rpc.origin-trail.network#/explorer).

Metamask connection parameters:

<table><thead><tr><th width="365">Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>chainID</td><td>2043</td></tr><tr><td>Network Name</td><td>OriginTrail Parachain Mainnet</td></tr><tr><td>RPC Endpoint</td><td><a href="https://astrosat-parachain-rpc.origin-trail.network/">https://astrosat-parachain-rpc.origin-trail.network/</a></td></tr><tr><td>Token symbol</td><td>MOTP</td></tr><tr><td>Block Explorer URL</td><td>(coming soon)</td></tr></tbody></table>

Note: because of difference in token decimals between ETH (18) and OTP (12), one token in Metamask will be equal to 1 milion OTPs. This issue will be resolved in the following releases.



### OriginTrail Parachain Testnet

{% hint style="success" %}
The Parachain Testnet is the testing environment for the OriginTrail Parachain. It is the recommended environment for all DKG & Parachain development purposes - if you are building a dapp or smart contract, you can use the testnet as your "staging" environment.
{% endhint %}

### OriginTrail Parachain Devnet

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Parachain Devnet is the early development blockchain, used by the OriginTrail Core Developers as an experimental environment and is **not recommended** for use by builders. It's a rapidly changing environment and will see occasional breaking changes.
