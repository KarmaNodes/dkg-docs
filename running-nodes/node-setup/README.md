Currently there are two blockchains available to setup node on. One VPS server can host node on each blockchain.

You need the following tokens to setup a node:

*   for a testnet node:

    > * For Ethereum: at least 3000 test TRAC tokens and at least 0.05 test Ether
    > * For xDai: at least 3000 test xTRAC tokens and at least 0.01 xDai
*   for a mainnet node:

    > * For Ethereum: at least 3500+ TRAC tokens and at least 0.1 Ether
    > * For xDai: at least 3500+ xTRAC tokens and at least 0.01 xDai
