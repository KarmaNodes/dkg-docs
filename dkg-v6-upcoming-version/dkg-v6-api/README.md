# DKG v6 API

The v6 API of OriginTrail is a work-in-progress and is bound to change during the development process. The current API has been modelled based on the Google Knowledge Graph Search API.

The API currently enables:

* publishing/resolving verifiable assertions
* running search queries for entities and assertions
* querying your local node via SPARQL
* retrieving proofs for obtained triples

The v6 API documentation is available in [Swagger](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/TraceLabs/ot-node-v6/1.0.0#/)

The Postman collection is available at [this link](https://github.com/OriginTrail/ot-node/tree/v6/develop/postman).
