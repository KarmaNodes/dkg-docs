# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to official OriginTrail Docs

The OriginTrail tech stack is purposefully designed to bring real world assets into the Web3, enabling discoverability, verifiability and connectivity of physical and digital assets in one coherent Web3 data ecosystem. It is built on a set of tools and protocols evolving as the [semantic](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) layer of Web3. It is a two-layer system connecting blockchain technology on "Layer 1" and knowledge graph technology on "Layer 2", supporting the **OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)**.&#x20;

The core unit of the Layer 2 DKG network - the **OriginTrail DKG node** - is the ultimate data service for your Web3 applications. OriginTrail DKG is a powerful Web3 backend, and together with **DKG SDKs** you can create graph-native Web3 applications, interfacing with verifiable assets on the DKG.

The DKG enables you to:

* Easily discover, query and integrate datasets from multiple sources
* Securely share semantic data (knowledge) across systems and [dapps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized\_application)
* Monetize your APIs and data, using fungible and non-fungible tokens (knowledge tokens)
* Easily build custom verifiable data pipelines
* Integrate with existing SSI & blockchain tooling

_Note: This site is primarily built for **developers** and **OriginTrail network node runners** - if you are looking to learn more about the OriginTrail ecosystem, please visit_ [_the official website_](https://origintrail.io)_._
