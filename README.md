# Welcome to OriginTrail Documentation Hub

## Welcome to the OriginTrail official docs

OriginTrail technology is a set of tools and protocols evolving as the [semantic](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) layer for Web3, built on the OriginTrail **Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG).** Its function is to empower developers and system integrators utilizing decentralized knowledge exchange supported by emerging standards and DLT networks.

The DKG enables you to:

* Easily discover, query and integrate datasets from multiple sources
* Securely share semantic data (knowledge) across systems and [dapps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized\_application)
* Monetize your APIs and data, using fungible and non-fungible tokens (knowledge tokens)
* Easily build custom verifiable data pipelines
* Integrate with existing SSI & blockchain tooling

This documentation is structured in 4 sections:

* Introduction to OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph - we recommend starting here
* **For developers:** how to use the DKG as a Dapp builder
* **For node operators:** how to host the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph by running nodes
* Generally useful resources section

_Note: This site is primarily built for **developers** and **OriginTrail network node runners** - if you are looking to learn more about the OriginTrail ecosystem, please visit_ [_the official website_](https://origintrail.io)_._
