# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to official OriginTrail Docs

OriginTrail ecosystem is built on a set of tools and protocols evolving as the [semantic](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) layer of Web3. The heart of the ecosystem is the **OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)**, an open, collaborative network combining blockchain and knowledge graph technology. The core unit of the network - the **OriginTrail node** - is the ultimate data service for your Web3 applications. OriginTrail DKG is a powerful Web3 backend, and together with **DKG SDKs** you can create graph-native Web3 applications, interfacing with verifiable assets on the DKG.

The DKG enables you to:

* Easily discover, query and integrate datasets from multiple sources
* Securely share semantic data (knowledge) across systems and [dapps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized\_application)
* Monetize your APIs and data, using fungible and non-fungible tokens (knowledge tokens)
* Easily build custom verifiable data pipelines
* Integrate with existing SSI & blockchain tooling

This documentation is structured in 3 sections:

* Introduction to OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph - we recommend starting here
* **For developers and node operators:** explaining **how to build the DKG** and contribute to the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph by **running network nodes**
* Additional resources and links

_Note: This site is primarily built for **developers** and **OriginTrail network node runners** - if you are looking to learn more about the OriginTrail ecosystem, please visit_ [_the official website_](https://origintrail.io)_._
