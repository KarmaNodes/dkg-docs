# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to official OriginTrail Docs

OriginTrail is an ecosystem **building trusted knowledge infrastructure for artificial intelligence**. It aims to address the challenge of misinformation in the age of AI by driving discoverability and ensuring the origin of information. OriginTrail is dedicated to building a sustainable global economy by organizing trusted AI-ready Knowledge Assets. It builds upon its unique Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) in combination with multiple blockchains to drive value on the basis of network effects.

The DKG enables you to:

* Easily discover, query and integrate knowledge from multiple sources
* Securely share semantic data (knowledge) across systems and [dapps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized\_application)
* Monetize your APIs and data, using fungible and non-fungible tokens (knowledge tokens)
* Easily build custom verifiable data pipelines
* Integrate with existing SSI & blockchain tooling
