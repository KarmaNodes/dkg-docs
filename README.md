# üåç Welcome to the official OriginTrail Documentation

OriginTrail is an ecosystem dedicated to **organizing knowledge in the Verifiable Internet for AI by building trusted knowledge infrastructure**.&#x20;

It aims to address the challenge of misinformation in the age of AI by tackling the problems of AI hallucinations, data ownership and IP rights, centralization of power, bias and model collapse. It does so by building on core values of **information provenance**, **verifiability** and **positive incentive alignment** through organizing human knowledge in a **neuro-symbolic Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)** and the Decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (DRAG) framework.

To learn more about the vision of the Verifiable Internet for AI and DRAG check out the [ecosystem white paper](decentralized-knowledge-graph/ecosystem-white-paper.md).

To learn more about the inner workings of the DKG and to participate [start here](decentralized-knowledge-graph/dkgintro.md).
