# Running a DKG node

The OriginTrail Decentralized Network is a permissionless system that hosts the Decentralized Knowledge Graph and is ran by the OriginTrail community. **Anyone, anywhere can run an OriginTrail DKG node -** you require no permission, and you can even expand node functionalities as it is completely open source software.&#x20;

By running a DKG node, you will contribute valuable resources to the network and as your node hosts a piece of the DKG, it will receive a portion of the publishing fees (paid by knowledge publishers).&#x20;

However running a DKG node requires some degree of technical knowledge, so you are advised to carefully consider all of the relevant implications of doing so. In the following pages you will get detailed instructions on how to setup a DKG node, and we encourage you to seek assistance if needed within the [OriginTrail community Discord](https://discord.com/invite/FCgYk2S) server
