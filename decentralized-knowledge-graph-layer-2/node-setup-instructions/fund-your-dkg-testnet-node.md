# Fund your DKG testnet node

OriginTrail DKG v6 testnet nodes operate on the OriginTrail Parachain testnet and Gnosis Chiado, and therefore operate with test tokens. For a node to be operational, it requires TRAC and OTP or xDAI test tokens for OTP testnet or Gnosis Chiado.

In order to get your test tokens, first join our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/FCgYk2S).

Once you've joined our server, enter the discord-bot channel.\
