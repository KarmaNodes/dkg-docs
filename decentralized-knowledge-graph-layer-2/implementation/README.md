# Implementation

{% hint style="info" %}
This page is a work in progress. Expect rapid updates until the launch of OriginTrail v6.
{% endhint %}

The OriginTrail DKG runs as a peer-to-peer network (OriginTrail Decentralized Network) of OriginTrail nodes (ot-nodes) cooperating on the basis of OriginTrail protocol. Multiple implementations of ot-nodes are planned, with the current implementation [available here](https://github.com/origintrail/ot-node).

Learn more about [ot-node modules here](modules.md) and the [command system](command-executor.md) implementation here.&#x20;

Find out more about the [v6 node configuration on this page](broken-reference).



More implementaion information to be included over the course of the following releases.
