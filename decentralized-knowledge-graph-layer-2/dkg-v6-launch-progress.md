### DKG v6 development progress status

The OriginTrail DKGv6 testnet has been successfully integrated with the OriginTrail Parachain testnet, introducing [UALs, DKG asset graphs](dkg-asset-graphs.md) and the stage 2 implementation of TRAC and OTP token features. Stage 2 proceeds with the final validation and testing of OriginTrail v6 protocol implementation in the Polkadot environment with EVM support, and will be used for rolling out the complete OriginTrail feature set in consecutive Stage 2 releases.&#x20;

The Stage 2 DKGv6 testnet operates **only on** the OriginTrail Parachain testnet (removing the integration the Polygon Mumbai testnet for the time being).&#x20;

The latest release can be found [**here**](https://github.com/OriginTrail/ot-node/tags)**.**
