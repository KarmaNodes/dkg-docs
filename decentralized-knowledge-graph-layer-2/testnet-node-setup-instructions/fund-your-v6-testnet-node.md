# Fund your v6 testnet node

OriginTrail v6 testnet nodes operate on the OriginTrail Parachain testnet, and therefore operate with test tokens. For a node to be operational, it requires OTP and TRAC test tokens for OTP testnet.

In order to get your OTP and TRAC test tokens, first join our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/FCgYk2S).

Once you've joined our server, enter the discord-bot channel.\

To request test OTP tokens type in:\
\
`!fundme_`_`otp <substrate_wallet_address`_`>` \
\
To request test TRAC tokens type in:\
&#x20;`!fundme_`_`otp_trac <ethereum_wallet_address>`_

The OriginTrail\_Bot will respond back in chat and send you some tokens on the OriginTrail Parachain testnet.\
