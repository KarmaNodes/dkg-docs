# Implementation

The OriginTrail DKG runs as a peer-to-peer network (OriginTrail Decentralized Network) of OriginTrail nodes (ot-nodes) cooperating on the basis of OriginTrail protocol. Multiple implementations in various programming languages of ot-nodes are planned, with the current implementation in JavaScript [available here](https://github.com/origintrail/ot-node).

Learn more about [ot-node modules here](modules.md) and the [command system](command-executor.md) implementation here.&#x20;

Find out more about the [v6 node configuration on this page](broken-reference).



More implementation information to be included over the course of the following releases.
