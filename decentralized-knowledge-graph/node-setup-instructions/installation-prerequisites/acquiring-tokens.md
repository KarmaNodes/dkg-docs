# Acquiring tokens

## Mainnet:

The OriginTrail DKG nodes operate with a two token system:&#x20;

* the TRAC token which is the native utility token of the DKG used for knowledge publishing, and&#x20;
* the native blockchain token of the chosen chain, used for interacting with DKG smart contracts (e.g NeuroWeb, Gnosis, Ethereum etc and their native tokens)

In order for your node to successfully start and run, you will need to provide these tokens to its **operational wallet.**

For more information on OriginTrail two-layer utility tokens - both TRAC and OTP, please check the following page: [https://parachain.origintrail.io/whitepaper?section=trac-otp-tokenomics](https://parachain.origintrail.io/whitepaper?section=trac-otp-tokenomics)

#### Layer 2 utility token - TRAC

The Trace token (TRAC) is the utility token of the DKG (layer 2 of OriginTrail). It is required to perform operations such as publishing knowledge to the network, and is a utility token that drives the entire DKG. Nodes in the DKG can operate in two ways:&#x20;

* **as non-hosting network gateways**, which enables access to the DKG and communication with other network nodes, without hosting the DKG
* **as hosting nodes,** which apart from being network gateways also host a portion of the DKG knowledge assets, for which they receive TRAC publishing fees as rewards. **To run a hosting node in OriginTrail DKG, your node requires at least 50.000 TRAC tokens posted as a security collateral to the network**

#### How can you acquire TRAC?&#x20;

TRAC token can be accessed through multiple (decentralized and centralized) platforms. A non-exhaustive list includes:

* Coinbase&#x20;
* Huobi&#x20;
* Kucoin&#x20;
* Uniswap&#x20;
* Bancor&#x20;
* Wintermute (over-the-counter)

More options can be found on [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/origintrail/) or [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/origintrail#markets) platforms.

**IMPORTANT: There is no association between the core development team and the above mentioned platforms. You should familiarise yourself with all possible risks of using their services as you are doing so under your own responsibility.**

#### Layer 1 utility tokens

OriginTrail has over time evolved into a multichain system (supporting Ethereum, Polkadot, Polygon and Gnosis blockchains) and for a fully functional hosting node you will require native tokens of the blockchains you intend to run it on as well.

## Testnet:

As described in the beginning of this tutorial, OriginTrail DKG node can be deployed on the following testnet blockchains:

1. NeuroWeb testnet
2. Chiado (Gnosis testnet)

In order to acquire testnet tokens for the above listed blockchain, please refer to OriginTrail's Discord Faucet usage [instructions](../useful-resources/dkg-testnet-faucet.md).
